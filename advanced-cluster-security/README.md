# Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

This repository contains two policies:
* `acs-central-policy` - Deploy Central to "hub" cluster.
* `acs-securedcluster-policy` - Deploy and configure `SecureCluster` resources in all clusters (including hub).

This is a **demo** configuration that reduces the amount of resources required to run Central.  It is *not* meant for production deployments.
